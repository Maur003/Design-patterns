# Design-patterns

## Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns are centered around the creation of objects, offering versatility and encapsulation during instantiation. This repository showcases various creational patterns, including:

Singleton: Guarantees a single instance of a class and provides a global point of access to it.
Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects while enabling subclasses to adjust the types of objects created.
Abstract Factory: Offers an interface for generating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder: Segregates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing diverse representations to emerge from the same construction process.

## Structural Patterns
Structural design patterns concentrate on the composition of classes and objects. They address how classes or objects are composed to form larger structures. This repository presents several structural patterns, such as:

Adapter: Facilitates the collaboration of incompatible interfaces.
Decorator: Dynamically incorporates behavior into objects without altering their structure.
Proxy: Functions as a surrogate for another object, governing access to it.
Facade: Offers a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral design patterns highlight the interaction between objects, emphasizing how objects communicate. The repository contains examples of various behavioral patterns, including:

Observer: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, all its dependents are automatically notified and updated.
Strategy: Defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and enables them to be interchangeable.
Chain of Responsibility: Enables an object to transmit a request through a series of handlers.
Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to be parameterized with queues, requests, and operations.

Each pattern example in this repository is accompanied by comprehensive explanations and Java code snippets illustrating its implementation. You're encouraged to explore and utilize these examples to enrich your comprehension and implementation of design patterns in Java projects.
